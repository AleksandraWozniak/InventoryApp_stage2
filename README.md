# Project 8: InventoryApp_stage1

Inventory App (book store app) allows a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app stores information about the product name, price, quantity, supplier name, and supplier phone number.

Steps used here were:
•	Creating a SQLite table in the app
•	Populating that table with new entries
•	Modifying the entries
•	Displaying the contents of the table to users.

This is just a practice app for the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships">Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics</a> I received for the Android Basics path (Udacity courses ud836/nd803).
