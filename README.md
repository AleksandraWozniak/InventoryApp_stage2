# Project 9: InventoryApp_stage2

Inventory App (book store app) allows a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app stores information about the product name, price, quantity, supplier name, and supplier phone number.

•	Creating a SQLite table in the app
•	Populating that table with new entries
•	Modifying the entries
•	Storing information in a SQLite database
•	Integrating Android’s file storage systems into that database
•	Setting up a Content Provider and use it to access a repository of data
•	Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
•	Updating information based on user input
•	Creating intents to other apps using stored information

This is just a practice app for the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships">Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics</a> I received for the Android Basics path (Udacity courses ud836/nd803).
